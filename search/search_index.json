Partners specializing in industry solutions highlight the substantial time investment, often up to 6 months, needed to initiate a new industry solution offering, which includes learning new AWS services. Consequently, there is an escalating demand for solution accelerators  to truly enable agility and differentiation, expediting the initial phase and streamlining the process. In response to this, we launched the <code>AWS Industry Blueprints for Data &amp; AI</code> in May 2023, with mission to empowers partners to accelerate their industry solution development processes and enhance profitability by offering detailed architectural guidance alongside reusable technical components and partner ecosystem products, streamlining the creation of industry-specific solutions through defined patterns. AWS Industry Blueprints for Data &amp; AI covers the end-to-end data journey with a primary focus on the process of <code>Turning Data into Insights</code>. </p> <p>Since launch, AWS partners have enthusiastically embraced the AWS Industry Blueprints for Data &amp; AI, recognizing the value it brings in accelerating their industry solution development. A prime example of this success is the <code>Slalom</code>, which launched the <code>Fan360 Data Platform</code> in just 9 weeks by leveraging the architectural guidance and reusable components provided by the Industry Blueprints. Manchester (UK) Data Leader, Slalom Jon Cowen said \u201cIndustry Blueprints for Data &amp; AI have been a game-changer for building best-in-class solutions in Data &amp; Analytics, at pace. The pre-built solution templates and best practices have enabled us to rapidly create &amp; deploy solutions with unparalleled repeatability, scalability, and a significantly reduced time to market.
