# Amazon Partner Network (APN) Blueprints for Industry Solutions

## What is APN Blueprints?

APN Blueprints offers a suite of building components, including Terraform, CDK code, CloudFormation templates, and solution accelerators, streamlining the configuration and deployment of tailored solutions across various industry verticals. Users can swiftly provision production-ready modern compute platforms, set up foundational data ingestion components or add customized ones for specific use cases. Additionally, the Blueprints incorporate ISV products with specialized capabilities to meet specific requirements of industries by customers (E.g. Enterprise Data Catalog component by [`Collibra`](https://www.collibra.com/us/en); Data compliance component by [`Alation`](https://www.alation.com/); CDP component by [`Tealium`](https://tealium.com/)). Each blueprint provides prescriptive architecture guidance with componentized runnable technical artifacts, simplifying the development of industry-specific solutions with pattern-based definitions. 
 
## Background

The digital transformation of industries is compelling AWS customers to prioritize agility, adaptability, and transformation. Partners specializing in industry solutions highlight the substantial time investment, often up to 6 months, needed to initiate a new industry solution offering, which includes learning new AWS services. Consequently, there is an escalating demand for solution accelerators  to truly enable agility and differentiation, expediting the initial phase and streamlining the process. In response to this, we launched the [`AWS Industry Blueprints for Data & AI`](./index1.md) in May 2023, with mission to empowers partners to accelerate their industry solution development processes and enhance profitability by offering detailed architectural guidance alongside reusable technical components and partner ecosystem products, streamlining the creation of industry-specific solutions through defined patterns. AWS Industry Blueprints for Data & AI covers the end-to-end data journey with a primary focus on the process of `Turning Data into Insights`. 

Since launch, AWS partners have enthusiastically embraced the AWS Industry Blueprints for Data & AI, recognizing the value it brings in accelerating their industry solution development. A prime example of this success is the [`Slalom`](https://www.slalom.com/us/en), which launched the [`Fan360 Data Platform`](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/game-on-getting-the-most-out-of-slalom-sports-fan-engagement-data-platform-accelerator/) in just 9 weeks by leveraging the architectural guidance and reusable components provided by the Industry Blueprints. Manchester (UK) Data Leader, Slalom Jon Cowen said “Industry Blueprints for Data & AI have been a game-changer for building best-in-class solutions in Data & Analytics, at pace.
The pre-built solution templates and best practices have enabled us to rapidly create & deploy solutions with unparalleled repeatability, scalability, and a significantly reduced time to market.
It‘s been a critical tool in helping us drive innovation and build the Fan Data Platform accelerator, faster than we thought possible! ”

[`EKS Blueprints`](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/bootstrapping-clusters-with-eks-blueprints/) launched in 2022 streamlines application deployment, reducing development hours and consulting costs. It boasts 2.5k+ stars on GitHub, 4.2k weekly users, and contributions from ~240 individual developers. Positive feedback from clients like [`SunLife`](https://www.sunlife.com/en/), [`The DoD`](https://www.defense.gov/), and [`Rivian`](https://rivian.com/) spurred the creation of ECS Blueprints and the AWS Observability Accelerator, responding to key industry trends. Blueprints have facilitated projects for [`Boston Consulting Group`](https://www.bcg.com/) and [`Pinterest`](https://www.pinterest.com/), among others.

While Industry Blueprints focuses on vertical end-to-end data journeys, EKS Blueprints have excelled in the horizontal application modernization space since launch, making it pivotal for industries on the foundational compute platform provision; thus, we are unifying both into APN Blueprints for Industry Solutions. APN Blueprints aligns closely with AWS industry verticals and the key use cases within those verticals, aiming to provide comprehensive build accelerators that align with the solution pillars of various industries, enabling partners to rapidly develop and launch tailored solutions that address the specific needs of their customers. This strategic alignment with industry verticals and use cases further enhances the value proposition of the Blueprints, empowering partners to create even more differentiated and impactful industry offerings for their clients.
