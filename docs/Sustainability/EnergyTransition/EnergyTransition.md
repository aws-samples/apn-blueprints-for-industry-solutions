# Energy Transition

## Solution Area Overview

The Energy Transition solution area focuses on accelerating the shift from fossil fuels to renewable and clean energy sources to mitigate climate change. This involves developing and deploying technologies for renewable power generation, energy storage, grid modernization, electrification of transportation and buildings, and integrated energy management systems.
 
## Use Cases

| Use Case | Overview | AWS Solutions | Partner Solutions |
| :---: | --- | :---: | :---: |
| **Battery Performance Management** | Battery performance management solutions optimize the charging, discharging, and thermal regulation of batteries used in electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and other applications to maximize their efficiency, safety, and lifespan. This helps enable widespread adoption of battery-powered technologies and integration of intermittent renewable energy sources onto the grid. | [Guidance for Electric Vehicle Battery Health Prediction](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/electric-vehicle-battery-health-prediction-on-aws/?did=sl_card&trk=sl_card) | |
| **Renewable Energy Transition** | Renewable energy transition solutions support the large-scale deployment of solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and other clean power generation technologies. This includes project planning, financing, grid integration, and the development of smart grid infrastructure to reliably and cost-effectively replace fossil fuel-based electricity generation. | [Guidance for Renewables Data Lake and Analytics](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/renewables-data-lake-and-analytics-on-aws/?did=sl_card&trk=sl_card) | |
